### Synopsis

<!-- AUTOGENERATED USAGE DESCRIPTIONS -->

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Create or verify a user named `<username>` in the specified registry, and
save the credentials to the `.npmrc` file. If no registry is specified,
the default registry will be used (see [`config`](/using-npm/config)).

The username, password, and email are read in from prompts.

To reset your password, go to <https://www.npmjs.com/forgot>

To change your email address, go to <https://www.npmjs.com/email-edit>

You may use this command multiple times with the same user account to
authorize on a new machine.  When authenticating on a new machine,
the username, password and email address must all match with
your existing record.

`npm login` is an alias to `adduser` and behaves exactly the same way.
